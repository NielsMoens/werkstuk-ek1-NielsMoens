# my Mobdev End Project: Horecoa
You create an application that will assist the hospitality industry in Ghent during this hard corona period. Visitors to a catering business can check in and out via a mobile application. In this way it is known who visits a business and when and we can use the data to give visitors in the area an overview of the cases that have not yet reached their maximum capacity.
